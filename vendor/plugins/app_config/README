=== Accessing the AppConfig object
After installing this plugin, the AppConfig object will be global available.  Entries are accessed via object member notation:
 AppConfig.my_config_entry
Nested entries are supported:
 AppConfig.my_section.some_entry

=== Config file
Define your config in
 Rails.root/config/app_config.yml

It will the the section called "defaults", and then it will override that with  the section that matches the Rails.env, so it should look something like this:

<tt>RAILS_ROOT/config/app_config.yml:</tt>
  defaults: 
    something: is set to boo
    something_else: is set to yeah

  development:
    something_else: is overridden to hell yeah

  production:
    something: is overridden to booyeah
